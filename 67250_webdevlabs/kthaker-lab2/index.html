        <p id = "intro">I am a first-year Information Systems student @ CMU. Originally from the Philly area, I am heavily involved on campus through many 
            activities and organizations like Girls Who Code, Women in IS, Dietrich Student Advisory Board, Tartan Ambassadors, and the CMU AI Safety Initiative.
            I am very interested in AI, and am looking to pursue a minor or double major to further explore this field of study. In my free time, I love to spend 
            time with family and friends, travel and visit beautiful places with delicious foods, and binge-watch shows like the Office and Survivor!
